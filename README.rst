django CMS Demo
===============

A demo site that shows a simple django CMS setup. I've included the sqlite
database and some media into the project to make it easier to see how 
django CMS works.

Get the code and run the project locally.  Make sure to checkout the 
frontend editing feature and try to add some pages.
